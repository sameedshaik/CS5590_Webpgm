Home AI – Lunch Suggestions App	


One of the most difficult decisions we make on a day-to-day basis, is deciding what to eat for lunch.
As creatures of habit, the truth is that our lunch options are fairly limited. 
So just by asking Alexa for a type of cuisine, the time to figure out where to eat can be significantly reduced!
We used Amazon Web Services, Lambda, Alexa voice services to develop it.
